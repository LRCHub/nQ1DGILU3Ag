```lrc
[00:31.88] Corrupt binary codes infecting my mind
[00:35.70] Perform invocation with numbing freeze
[00:39.55] Querying for a variable and seizing the time
[00:43.20] To recompile and trigger my destiny
[01:00.70] 
[00:49.07] Though my wings've been bloodstained and could never rid
[00:53.06] I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
[00:56.87] There is no "Exception" in this library
[01:00.47] For I know I will always go with you
[01:18.47] 
[01:19.83] Super hot projectiles pierce the wind
[01:23.90] I charged up my armor into light speed
[01:27.53] Querying for a variable and seizing the time
[01:31.30] In a new day coming not so far away
[01:48.80] 
[01:37.02] Though my wings've been bloodstained and could never rid
[01:40.93] I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
[01:44.84] There is no "Exception" in this library
[01:48.54] For I know I will always go with you
[02:06.54] 
[02:21.31] Though my wings've been bloodstained and could never rid
[02:25.16] I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
[02:28.98] There is no "Exception" in this library
[02:32.66] For I know I will always go with you
[02:50.66] 
[02:36.79] Though my wings've been bloodstained and could never rid
[02:40.37] I will try hard to soar to the heaven I dreamed
[02:44.25] There is no "Exception" in this library
[02:47.98] For I know I will always go with my heart
